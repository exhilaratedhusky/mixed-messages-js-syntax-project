for codecademy- full-stack engineer career path
Hi all,

this is for Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer career path- the first portfolio Project. The objective was to build a simple message generator program. The requirement for the output message was that it's supposed to be made up of at least 3 different pieces of data.
I'm not entirely sure of how good my code is, I struggled with node.js for a while, which got me a bit nervous.
